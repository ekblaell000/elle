#People to Know
---
This assighnment was for us to write about certain people that had created or contributed to the work of coding computers
This assighnment was important because it gave us a opportunity to understand how coding used to workd and how much 
it has changed.

Thoughts on People to Know Q1
	Charles Babbage
He created a programmable computer. This to me is the sort of basis towards coding. How the inventor could change a 
code into text to appear back then is a very big accomplishment. His invention is interesting because he created different
mechanisms that were able to take a certain piece of coding/ information and be able to translate it out in a different way.
I don't know if I can really connect to his invention except for the fact that he invented the first programmable computer 
because we use computers to code in Python 3 most of the time. If we didn't have the invention we wouldn't be able to code 
certain working programs.
Out of all the entries the one that I had found the least interesting was the one covering Joseph Marie Charles. 
This reason is because he invented a loom to weave textiles, I can understand why that could be related to coding and 
programmable computers but the invention was a loom, that I don't feel contributed as much as some other inventions towards 
the topic of coding. When you research Charles, his occupation is stated as a french weaver and merchant, from context you can
understand his job had nothing to do with mathematics and coding. He did however invent like some of the people mentioned but
only a loom, not really that much contributing towards coding except for the textiles. I will add in his defense that it 
contributed towards the technological revolution and may have changed certain aspects of coding but I didn't find this as 
important as Charles Babbage. I think ways to make the invention more interesting are maybe not make it as a basis for loom,
but maybe contribute more where it could be more considered as a program that could be coded like later on in Textiles and 
Python 3. I think this is just changing how the topic is discussed.
	I think the most challenging invention that any of the people of the topic created was John Backusâ€™ invention. 
  The reason I believe this is because he created a commonly used High level 
  programming language. I feel that many of the other inventors in People to know only invented machines that were very 
  important towards the contribution of Coding, but he created a high level language called FORTRAN, and he created more 
  ideas towards coding. I know this is very challenging because there are many different ways and styles to code, when you 
  can create a different language in coding that actually work, that is a lot of work.
	For an IB learner trait that I could give a inventor in people to know would be Charles babbage would be a Thinker,
  Knowledgeable, and communicator. The reason why I believe he was a thinker was because he could use the education he had 
  learned and put it towards creating a new  invention that was the basis for coding. He reason why I think he is
  Knowledgeable is because when you search up what his occupations were, they list Mathematician, Philosopher, and inventor. 
  These occupations imply he was knowledgeable because if you were someone of any of those descriptions you needed a high 
  education, and he had one (Graduated from the university of Cambridge). The last IB learner profile trait I had used was 
  Communicator. In the video of People to know, Charles Babbage is said to have collaborated with Ada Lovelace with creating
  coding, he would have to learn how to work with other people in order to do this therefore he is a communicator.
